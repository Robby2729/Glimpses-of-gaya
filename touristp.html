                Mahabodhi Temple’s storied past traces back over two millennia, to the reign of Emperor Ashoka in the 3rd century BCE. Driven by his profound conversion to Buddhism, Ashoka embarked on a mission to disseminate the Buddha’s teachings across his empire. His pilgrimage to Bodh Gaya culminated in the construction of a stupa marking the spot of Buddha’s enlightenment.

                Over successive centuries, Bodh Gaya flourished as a center of Buddhist pilgrimage and learning, attracting devotees and scholars from far and wide. The present-day Mahabodhi Temple complex evolved through multiple phases of construction and renovation, with contributions from various ruling dynasties, including the Mauryas, Guptas, and Palas.
                
                Despite enduring periods of decline and desecration, Mahabodhi Temple’s resilience and spiritual significance endured, culminating in its designation as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002. Today, it stands as a beacon of Buddhist faith and a testament to the enduring legacy of the Enlightened One.</P>

<p id="p1">The construction date of temple is unknown and it is believed that Rama along with Sita had visited this place. The present day structure was rebuilt by Devi Ahilya Bai Holkar, the ruler of Indore, in 1787, on the banks of the Falgu river.[8] Ahilyabai Holkar had crafted the temple, sent her officers to inspect and find the best stone for the temple in whole region, and they finally found munger black stone as the best choice in Jaynagar. Since there was no proper road and the mountains were very far from Gaya, the officers found another mountain where they can carve and easily bring the stone to Gaya the place was near Bathani (a small village in Gaya district). The officers brought the craftsmen from Rajasthan. They started carving the temple in Patharkatti (a village and also a tourist place in Bihar). The final temple was assembled in Gaya near Vishnupad temple site. After the completing the construction of temple many craftsmen returned to their native places, but some of them settled-down in Pattharkatti village itself. Bihar government has marked this place as one of the prominent tourist spots of Bihar.[9] The 1000 stone steps leading to the top of the Brahmajuni hill on southwest of the Vishnupad mandir gives the view of Gaya city and the Vishnupad temple, which is a tourist spot. There are also many small temples near this temple.</p>

Shelves on the interior walls display 16,300 small bronze images of the Buddha.[5] The Great Buddha statue is located in a garden at the end of Temple Street and is surrounded by smaller sculptures of Buddha's ten principal disciples, five on each side.[6] The Great Buddha was possibly the largest Buddha statue in India at the time and was consecrated on 18 November 1989 by the 14th Dalai Lama.[7] The foundation stone for the statue was laid in 1982.</p>

                    Before his enlightenment, Siddhartha led a life of extreme asceticism in these hills for several years. The caves at Dungeshwari are where he practiced severe austerities before realizing the futility of such measures. He then decided to follow the Middle Way, leading him to the Bodhi tree where he reached enlightenment. This historic significance makes Pragbodhi an essential destination for both pilgrims and history enthusiasts.
